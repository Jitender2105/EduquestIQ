            EduquestIQ is a lightweight but powerful learning management system designed for shared hosting
            environments such as Hostinger. It runs entirely on PHP 8 and MySQL 8 with no Node.js, build tools,
            or complex deployment steps.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            The platform is built around attributes and sub‑attributes (Academic, Creative, Leadership, Technical, and
            more) so every question, test, course, video, and resource contributes to a rich profile of each learner.
